- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Design Patterns

## Getting Started

Each project can be opened and run independently in Visual Studio:

1. Open the respective `.sln` file
2. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the application (F5)

## Note

These assignments represent academic coursework in C# programming and demonstrate progressive learning from basic console applications to complex Windows Forms systems with proper software engineering practices.
